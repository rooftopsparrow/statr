Statr
=====

Don't stutter or stumble with quick statistical calculations.  

This library is in *very* early stages and is aimed for students learning probability and statistics and don't want to waste hours on end doing stats homework. 

## Goals ##
- Full blown library thats really easy to manipulate
- Graduate to Rails or Sinatra for graphing capabilities
